# scripts

Various scripts, configs, partials, and random code that I find useful in my projects.

Consider all code in this repo to be public domain.

## Boilerplate

### ESlint

[JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/) as a basis with personal preferences and the ease of use with eslint itself:

```bash
npm install --save-dev \
    babel-eslint \
    eslint \
    eslint-config-standard \
    eslint-config-standard-react \
    eslint-plugin-promise \
    eslint-plugin-react \
    eslint-plugin-standard
```

Usage (recommend embedding in a package.json script). Note: Quotes are
necessary to trigger string being treated as glob expression:

```
eslint "src/**/*.js?(x)"
```

Recommend keeping `.eslintrc` file named as is as it seems certain tools still only look for that name.
