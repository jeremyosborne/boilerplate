# One repo, many npm packages

Within some contexts, it makes sense to manage multiple, and often related packages in a single git repo. [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is a tool that aids with doing that.

I'm new to using Lerna, and before coming up with boilerplate documentation, recommend review of the [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) repo for inspiration, and for my own experiments see [trinkets](https://github.com/jeremyosborne/trinkets).
